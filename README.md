Cloude flying - proximity to gliding site. No glider shall enter cloud within radius of 5 nm of a gliding site, exception from at least 200 feet from below the lowest part of the cloud unless the pilot has announced that intention by radio.

Minimum joint AT experience
The sum of the tows made by the tug pilot and the glider pilot, in their respective capacities, shall not be less than six.

Atmospheric pressure reduces with altitude; halving every 18,000 ft

500ft - fly no closer to anything (except hill soaring, take-off, landing);
1,500ft â€“ above the highest fixed object within 600 metres of the aircraft
Within 3,000ft - assembly of 1,000+ people
