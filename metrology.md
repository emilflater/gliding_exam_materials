# Heat transfer

- **Convection** the movement of hotter and therefore less dense material up, and colder, denser material down - under the 
influence of gravity, which consequently results in transfer of heat.

- **Radiation** the emission of energy, which consequently results in transfer of energy (heat in our case).


# Air bubbles 

- **Bubbles** are formed by the heated ground, once they absorbe enough heat (energy) they start to rise. As they travel up, they expand.
Bubbles stop to rise once their temperature is equal to the surrounding air temperature.

- **Adiabatic expansion** while bubble of heated air rises, it progressively expands and cools down (expands => less dense => temp drops).

- **Adiabatic compression** while bubble of cold air sinks, it progressively shirnks and warms up (shirnks => more dense => temp rises).


# Coriolis Force

Coriolis Force is caused by the rotation of the Earth. Objects in the Northern Hemisphere are deflected (pl: odchylone) to the right, while objects in the Southern Hemisphere are deflected to the left. The coriolis effect thus tries to force winds to shift towards the right or left.

Examples:
- water swirl down the plug hole,
- the spiraling wind pattern (which helps the hurricane to form),
- surface ocean currents (as they are driven by the movement of wind over the water's surface),
- cyclones and anticyclones rotations.


# High vs low pressure systems

The Earth's atmosphere exerts (pl: wywiera) a pressure on the surface. Pressure is measured in hectoPascals (hPa), also called millibars. As air warms, it ascends leading to low pressure at the surface. As air cools, it descends leading to high pressure at the surface.

|         | High pressure | Low pressure |
| ------------- |:------------- |:------------ |
| **Air**           | sink  | rise    |
| **Rotation**      | clockwise   | anticlockwise |
| **Condensation**       | down => dry weather and mostly clear skies | up => cloud formation and ultimately precipitation | 
| **Isobar circular shape**           | anticyclone   | cyclone       |
| **Isobar oblong or elongate** | ridges        | troughs (channel, gutter) |

# Ridges and Troughs

**Ridge**, with the barometer rising, has weather similar to that in an anticyclone. It is a wedge shaped area of high pressure between two areas of low pressure. It brings improving weather and clearing skies. It can lead to good gliding conditions particularly if the airmass is polar or returning polar maritime.

A Trough, with the barometer falling as it approaches, has characteristics similar to those of a depression. It is an elongated area of low pressure without distinctive fronts but often with cloud and rain. As this system moves West to East the local pressure will first fall and then rise again as the system passes. It may be indicated on a synoptic chart by a line. Gliding is likely to be poor.
