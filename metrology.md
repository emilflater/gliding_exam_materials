Radiation

# Heat transfer

- **Convection** the movement of hotter and therefore less dense material to rise, and colder, denser material to sink under the 
influence of gravity, which consequently results in transfer of heat.

- **Radiation** the emission of energy, which consequently results in transfer of energy (heat in our case).


# Air bubbles 

- **Bubbles** are formed by the heated ground, once they absorbe enough heat (energy) they start to rise. As they travel up, they expand.
Bubbles stop to rise once their temperature is equal with the surrounding air temperature.

- **Adiabatic expansion** while bubbles of heated air rise and expand, they also progresivley cool down.


# Coriolis Force

Because surface ocean currents are driven by the movement of wind over the water's surface, the Coriolis force also affects the movement of ocean currents and cyclones as well. Many of the ocean's largest currents circulate around warm, high-pressure areas called gyres. Though the circulation is not as significant as that in the air, the deflection caused by the Coriolis effect is what creates the spiraling pattern in these gyres. The spiraling wind pattern helps the hurricane form. The stronger the force from the Coriolis effect, the faster the wind spins and picks up additional energy, increasing the strength of the hurricane
