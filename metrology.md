Radiation

# Heat transfer

- **Convection** the movement of hotter and therefore less dense material to rise, and colder, denser material to sink under the 
influence of gravity, which consequently results in transfer of heat.

- **Radiation** the emission of energy, which consequently results in transfer of energy (heat in our case).

# Bubbles 

- **Bubbles** are formed by the heated ground, once they absorbe enough heat (energy) they start to rise. As they travel up, they expand.
Bubbles stop to rise once their temperature is equal with the surrounding air temperature.


- **Adiabatic expansion** while bubbles of heated air rise and expand, they also progresivley cool down.
