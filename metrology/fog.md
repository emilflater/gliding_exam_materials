# Dew and Frost Point

- **Dew Point**, the temperature at which a given parcel of humid air, starts to form water drops.

- **Frost Point**, the temperature at which a given parcel of humid air, turns into ice without 
going through the liquid phase.

# Fog

**Fog** arises as the result of the condensation of water vapor at or near the Earth's surface.

The reason for condensation is lowering the temperature to the dewpoint, point at which water vapor 
turns into water drops. A further drop in temperature causes the excess of water vapor 
to condense, therefore a drizzle (pl: m≈ºawka) often appears along with the fog.

- Consists of suspended water droplets or ice crystals.
- Can be considered as a type of low-lying cloud.
- Is influenced by nearby water, topography and wind conditions.

## Radiation Fog

Arises from the radiation of heat. Usually happens during the night hours, when the weather 
is cloudless and wind is not strong. If temperature of moist air drops to its dewpoint, fog will get formed.

## Advection fog

Forms based on the inflow of warm and humid airmass over the cooled surface (land or water). Air cools down and over time 
it reaches the dewpoint. 

- **colder seasons**, more common over land,
- **spring and summer**, when warm air above land moves over cooler waters, fog appears above the water surface.
