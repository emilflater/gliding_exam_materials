# Air masses

**Air mass** is a volume of air defined by its temperature and humidity.

There are six main types of air masses that affect the British Isles. We classify them depending on:

1. whether they originate over land or sea:
    - continental (dry),
    - maritime (moist).

2. the particular region in which they form:
   - arctic or antarctic (cold), 
   - tropical (warm),
   - polar (cold).

## Weather fronts




**Weather fronts** mark the boundary between two air masses, which often have contrasting properties. For example, one cold and dry and the other relatively warm and moist.
