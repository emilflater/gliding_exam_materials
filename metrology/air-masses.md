- **cold front**, the triangles can be thought of as icicles,
- **warm front**, the semicircles can be thought of as half suns,

## Cold front

Cold air is advancing and pushing underneath warmer air, as the cold air is 'heavier', or more dense, than the warm air.

## Warm front

Warm air is advancing and rising up over cold air, as warm air is 'lighter' or less dense, than cold air.

## Occluded front

- Are formed when a cold front overtakes a warm front (as cold front moves faster then warm front).
- Are linked with areas of low pressure / depressions. When a depression forms, there is usually a warm front and a faster moving cold  - - The word *occluded* can be (sort of) translated as *hidden*. When occlusion occurs, the cold front catches up with the warm front, progressively the warm air is then lifted up from the surface, and therefore *hidden*.

There are two types of occlusion:

- **cold occlusion**, the air mass overtaking the warm front is colder than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses,
- **warm occlusion**, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cold as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air.


# Air masses

**Air mass** is a volume of air defined by its temperature and humidity.

There are six main types of air masses that affect the British Isles. We classify them depending on:

1. whether they originate over land or sea:
    - continental (dry),
    - maritime (moist).

2. the particular region in which they form:
   - arctic or antarctic (cold), 
   - tropical (warm),
   - polar (cold).

# Weather fronts

**Weather front** marks the boundary between two air masses, which often have contrasting properties. For example, one air mass may be cold and dry and the other relatively warm and moist.

- **Strength** of a front is the difference in temperature between two air masses. If very cold air comes into contact with very warm air the front is described as 'strong' or 'intense'. If there is little difference in temperature between the two air masses, the front is considered to be weak.
