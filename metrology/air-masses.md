# Air masses

**Air mass** is a volume of air defined by its temperature and humidity.

There are six main types of air masses that affect the British Isles. We classify them depending on:

1. whether they originate over land or sea:
    - continental (dry),
    - maritime (moist).

2. the particular region in which they form:
   - arctic or antarctic (cold), 
   - tropical (warm),
   - polar (cold).

## Polar Maritime

**Often produces good gliding conditions** 12 or 24 hours after the cold front has passed. 

This air mass starts very cold and dry but during its long passage over the relatively warm waters of the North Atlantic its temperature rises rapidly and it becomes unstable.

**Polar Maritime** :
- is the most common air mass to affect the British Isles,
- characterised by frequent showers at any time of the year. 

 **Winter** months when instability (convection) is most vigorous over the sea, hail and thunder are common across much of the western and northern side of the British Isles. Eastern Britain may see fewer showers as here the surface heating is reduced. 
    
 **Summer** months the reverse is true, land temperatures are higher than sea temperatures and the heaviest showers occur over eastern England.

## Arctic Maritime

**Often produces good gliding conditions** 12 or 24 hours after the cold front has passed. 

**Arctic maritime** air mass has similar characteristics to a polar maritime air mass, but because of the shorter sea track the air is colder and less moist.

Arctic air is uncommon during the summer, but when it does occur it may bring heavy showers or thunderstorms and unseasonably low temperatures. Between October and May, the air is cold enough to produce hail showers or snow.

## Returning Polar Maritime

**May produce good gliding conditions well ahead of the warm front**


## Weather fronts

**Weather fronts** separate air masses with different density (temperature and/or moisture) characteristics. Once an air mass moves away from its source region, underlying vegetation and water bodies can quickly modify its character. Classification schemes tackle an air mass' characteristics, as well as modification.
