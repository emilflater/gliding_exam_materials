- In August, a post frontal weak ridge is forecast across the country the day after a cold front has passed through. What would be the most likely weather?

- Good soaring as a ridge reduces the instability behind the cold front preventing over convection.

<br/>

- Is it possible for thermals to develop under an extensive layer of strato-cumulus?

- Yes, if there is sufficient instability in the atmosphere.

<br/>

- What weather associated with cumulo nimbus is considered to be the worst hazard when landing a glider?

- Increased wind strength together with rapid direction changes, making landing in particular, very difficult.

<br/>

A sea breeze front has been forecast to penetrate inland beyond one of your chosen turning points. Assuming this takes place before you get there, what would be the expected weather conditions as you approach the TP?

- c

<br/>

- A high pressure inversion in summer will have what effects on soaring?

- Prevention of  the formation of cumulus, once the inversion is below the condensation level.

<br/>

The surface temperature is 20 degrees Celsius and the trigger temperature is 24 degrees Celsius. Assuming the environmental lapse rate 2 degrees C per 1000ft, the dry adiabatic lapse rate is 3 degreesC per 1000ft, assume the dew point is less than 15 degree

4000 feet

<br/>

- In the lower atmosphere, what is regarded as being the accepted reduction of pressure with increase in height?

- 1 mb per 30 feet.

# Done

- What effect in general, does a building high pressure system have on the level of an inversion?

- The level falls slowly as the high pressure system intensifies.
