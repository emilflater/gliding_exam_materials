# Wind

- **Wind** is caused by air moving from high pressure to low pressure, usually due to changes in temperature.

- **Wind direction** is reported by the direction from which it originates - a northerly wind blows from the north to the south.

- **Wind speed** increases with altitude. It is due to the fact that friction is less with height and there is no obstacles like treees, rocks, houses etc. Wind speed is messuared in knots.

# Veering and backing wind

- **Veering wind** is the wind which turns clockwise with height,
- **Backing wind** is the wind which turns anti-clockwise with height.

These terms can be also used to refere wind direction change at the certain height.

# Geostrophic wind
An air parcel initially at rest will move from high pressure to low pressure zone because of the pressure gradient force. As it moves, it is deflected by the Coriolis force to the right in the northern hemisphere. When the wind gains speed, the deflection increases until the Coriolis force equals the pressure gradient force (around 2000 ft). At this point, the wind will be blowing parallel to the isobars. When this happens, the wind is referred to as geostrophic.

The geostrophic wind:
- result from an exact balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force (this condition is called **geostrophic balance**),
- is directed parallel to isobars,
- the true wind almost always differs from the geostrophic wind (still it is a valuable approximation).

# Anabatics and Katabiatic winds

- **Anabatic** wind is a warm wind which blows up a steep slope or mountain side, driven by heating of the slope. It is also known as an upslope flow. These winds typically occur during the daytime in calm sunny weather. 

- **Katabatic** wind is a wind blows down a slope due to gravity. It when the highlands is cooled and the air in contact with these highlands is also cooled. Therefore it becomes denser than the air at the same elevation but away from the slope - so it begins to flow downhill. This wind is also called downslope wind, or gravity wind.
