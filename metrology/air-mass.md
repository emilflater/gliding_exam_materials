# Air masses

**Air mass** is a volume of air defined by its temperature and humidity.

There are six main types of air masses that affect the British Isles. We classify them depending on:

1. whether they originate over land or sea:
    - continental (dry),
    - maritime (moist).

2. the particular region in which they form:
   - arctic or antarctic (cold), 
   - tropical (warm),
   - polar (cold).

# Weather fronts

**Weather front** marks the boundary between two air masses, which often have contrasting properties. For example, one air mass may be cold and dry and the other relatively warm and moist.

**Strength** of a front is the difference in temperature between two air masses. If very cold air comes into contact with very warm air the front is described as 'strong' or 'intense'. If there is little difference in temperature between the two air masses, the front is considered to be weak.

# Weather front types

<br/>

- **cold front**, the triangles can be thought of as icicles,
- **warm front**, the semicircles can be thought of as half suns.

<br/>

## Cold front

- Cold air is advancing and pushing underneath warmer air, as the cold air is 'heavier', or more dense, than the warm air. 
- Characterized by abrupt uplift along the frontal boundary.
- The faster the front, the steeper the front slope.
- Associated with dramatic shifts in weather.
- Cumulus (flat based or anvil-shaped) development.
- Short duration heavy rain & thunderstorms.
- Rapid temperature decrease.
- Rapid change in wind direction.
- Squall line.
- Sinking air behind the front often leads to rapidly clearing skies.
- After the front the weather improves rapidly with clearing skies and showery weather leading to unstable air with good visibility â€“ **good gliding**.

### Squall Line

**Squall line**, a line of thunderstorms forming along or ahead of a cold front. Can cause a sudden increase and shift of wind (veering) heavy rain, snow, hail, thunder and lightning.

## Warm front

- Warm air is advancing and rising up over cold air, as warm air is 'lighter' or less dense, than cold air.
- Characterized by gentle uplift.
- Abouth half slower than the average cold front. 
- Very gentle slope (average 1:300 vs cold front).
- Frontal changes are less abrupt than cold air frontal passages.
- Mostly cloudy and cold (stratiform cloud cover).
- Long duration light to moderate rainfall, well ahead of the front.

## Occluded front

- Formed when a cold front overtakes a warm front (as cold front moves faster then warm front).
- Linked with areas of low pressure / depressions. When a depression forms, there is usually a warm front and a faster moving cold.
- Act like both warm and cold fronts.
- The word *occluded* can be (sort of) translated as *hidden*. When occlusion occurs, the cold front catches up with the warm front, progressively the warm air is then lifted up from the surface, and therefore *hidden*.

### Occlusion types

- **Cold occlusion**, the air mass overtaking the warm front is colder than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses.
- **Warm occlusion**, the air mass overtaking the warm front is warmer than  the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air.
