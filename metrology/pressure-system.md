# Heat transfer

- **Convection** the movement of hotter and therefore less dense material up, and colder, denser material down - under the 
influence of gravity, which consequently results in transfer of heat.

- **Radiation** the emission of energy, which consequently results in transfer of energy (heat in our case).

# Air bubbles 

- **Bubbles** are formed by the heated ground, once they absorb enough heat (energy) they start to rise. As they travel up, they expand.
Bubbles stop to rise once their temperature is equal to the surrounding air temperature.

- **Adiabatic expansion** while bubble of heated air rises, it progressively expands and cools down (expands => less dense => temp drops).

- **Adiabatic compression** while bubble of cold air sinks, it progressively shrinks and warms up (shrinks => more dense => temp rises).

# Coriolis Force

Coriolis Force is caused by the rotation of the Earth. Objects in the Northern Hemisphere are deflected (pl: odchylone) to the right, while objects in the Southern Hemisphere are deflected to the left. The Coriolis effect thus tries to force winds to shift towards the right or left.

Examples:
- water swirl down the plug hole,
- the spiralling wind pattern (which helps the hurricane to form),
- surface ocean currents (as they are driven by the movement of wind over the water's surface),
- cyclones and anticyclones rotations.

# High vs low pressure zones

The Earth's atmosphere exerts (pl: wywiera) a pressure on the surface. Pressure is measured in hectoPascals (hPa), also called millibars. As air warms, it ascends (air is sucked away from the surface) leading to low pressure at the surface. As air cools, it descends (air is pushed onto the surface) leading to high pressure at the surface.

|                               | High pressure | Low pressure              |
| ----------------------------- |:------------- |:------------------------- |   
| **Air**                       | sink          | rise                      |
| **Rotation**                  | clockwise     | anticlockwise             |
| **Isobar circular shape**     | anticyclone   | cyclone                   |
| **Isobar oblong or elongate** | ridges        | troughs (channel, gutter) |
| **Condensation**              | goes down => dry weather and mostly clear skies | goes up => cloud formation and ultimately precipitation |

# Pressure Gradient

**Pressure Gradient** describes direction and the pressure gain over a certain distance (expressed - Pascal/meter). As it describes pressure gain/increase, it points from low towards high pressure zone. Pressure gradient can be seen as two components, namely the vertical and the horizontal pressure gradients.

- **Vertical Pressure Gradient** is the main component and it is pointing roughly downwards (parallel to gravity force).

- **Horizontal Pressure Gradient** is relatively small but critical component, as it is largely responsible for the wind circulation. 

<br/>

# Pressure Gradient Force

**Pressure Gradient Force** is one of the main forces acting on the air to make it move as wind. It points from high towards low pressure zones (opposite direction to the pressure gradient).

# Buys Ballot Law

In the Northern Hemisphere, if a person stands with his back to the wind, the atmospheric pressure is low to the left, high to the right.

# Cyclones and Anticyclones

A cyclone — and its counterpart, an anticyclone — is a large-scale system of air circulation in the atmosphere which can be considered as either producing or resulting from differences in air pressure in high and low pressure zones.

- **Cyclone** or **Depression**, the central air pressure is lower than that of the surrounding environment, and the airflow is counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. Characterized by low-level convergence (pl: zbieżność, schodzenie się) and ascending air within the system.

- **Anticyclone**, the central air pressure is higher than that of its surroundings, and the airflow is clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. Characterized by low-level divergence (pl: rozbieżność) and subsiding (pl: zapadajać) air.

# Ridges and Troughs

- **Ridge** is an elongated area of relatively high pressure extending from the center of a high-pressure region. Brings improving weather and clearing skies. Usually good gliding conditions.

- **Trough** is an elongated area of relatively low pressure extending from the center of a low-pressure region. Brings clouds, showers, and a wind shift, particularly following the passage of the trough. Bad gliding conditions.

**Ridge**, with the barometer rising, has weather similar to that in an anticyclone. It is a wedge shaped area of high pressure between two areas of low pressure.

# Col

**Col** is an area of slack pressure between two areas of low pressure and two areas of high pressure. Winds are likely to be light and variable in direction.
