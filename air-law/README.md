D.	HASELL ( height, airframe, security, engine, location and lookout.) 

For flights above 10,000 ft amsl all pilots are recommended to use a supplementary oxygen supply with a visible contents gauge. In the event of illness in the air for any cause, a descent should be made to below 10,000 ft amsl.

# Right of way

- **Right of way**, the aircraft on right has right of way.

- **Head-on**, both aircrafs should alter course to their rights.

- **Overtaking**, overtaking aircraft shall at all times keeps out of the way of the one being overtaken, by altering course to the right (in UK right or left).


## Way priority

(lowest priority) aeroplanes (powered aircraft) --> aero-tows / gliders ---> balloons (highest piority)


## Landing

- **Landing**, the lower aircraft has right of way, but may not cut in front of another which is on the final approach, nor overtake that aircraft. 
- **Emergency landing**, the aircraft making of an emergency landing, has right of way.


## Hmmm..

- **Following Roads**, aircraft following roads, railways or other lines of landmarks in the UK shall keep such landmarks on their left.

# Low Flying

Except with the written permission of the CAA, a glider:
- flying over a congested area of a city town or settlement shall not fly below a height of 1,000 feet above the highest fixed obstacle within a horizontal radius of 600 metres of the glider or below such height as would permit the glider to land clear of the congested area if greater. 
- shall neither fly over an organised open-air assembly of more than 1,000 persons below the higher of 1,000 feet or such height as would permit the glider to land clear of the assembly nor land within 1,000 metres of the assembly

# Joining thermal

- **Right of way**, gliders established in a thermal have right of way.
- **Direction**, pilots shall circle in the same direction.
- **Both directions**, if there are gliders thermalling in opposite directions, 
join the same direction as the nearest glider (least vertical separation).

<br/>

# Ridge soaring

- **Turns**, make all turns away from the ridge (do not turn into the ridge).
- **Head-on**, gliders meeting head-on, alter course to the right.
- **Right of way**, the glider with the ridge on its right has right of way.
- **Overtaking**, a overtaking glider must pass between the other glider and the ridge.
