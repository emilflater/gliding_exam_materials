For flights above 10,000 ft amsl all pilots are recommended to use a supplementary oxygen supply with a visible contents gauge. In the event of illness in the air for any cause, a descent should be made to below 10,000 ft amsl.

# Right of way

- **Right of way**, the aircraft on right has right of way.

- **Head-on**, both aircrafs should alter course to their rights.

- **Overtaking**, overtaking aircraft shall at all times keeps out of the way of the one being overtaken, by altering course to the right (in UK right or left).


## Way priority

(lowest priority) aeroplanes (powered aircraft) --> aero-tows / gliders ---> balloons (highest piority)


## Landing

- **Landing**, the lower aircraft has right of way, but may not cut in front of another which is on the final approach, nor overtake that aircraft. 
- **Emergency landing**, the aircraft making of an emergency landing, has right of way.


## Hmmm..

- **Following Roads**, aircraft following roads, railways or other lines of landmarks in the UK shall keep such landmarks on their left.



# Joining thermal

- **Right of way**, gliders established in a thermal have right of way.
- **Direction**, pilots shall circle in the same direction.
- **Both directions**, if there are gliders thermalling in opposite directions, 
join the same direction as the nearest glider (least vertical separation).

<br/>

# Ridge soaring

- **Turns**, make all turns away from the ridge (do not turn into the ridge).
- **Head-on**, gliders meeting head-on, alter course to the right.
- **Right of way**, the glider with the ridge on its right has right of way.
- **Overtaking**, a overtaking glider must pass between the other glider and the ridge.
