# Joining thermal

- **Right of way**, gliders established in a thermal have right of way.
- **Direction**, pilots shall circle in the same direction.
- **Both directions**, if there are gliders thermalling in opposite directions, 
join the same direction as the nearest glider (least vertical separation).

# Ridge soaring

- **Turns**, make all turns away from the ridge (do not turn into the ridge).
- **Head-on**, gliders meeting head-on, alter course to the right.
- **Right of way**, the glider with the ridge on its right has right of way.
- **Overtaking**, a overtaking glider must pass between the other glider and the ridge.
